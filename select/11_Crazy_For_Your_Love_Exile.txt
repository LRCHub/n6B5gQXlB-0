Girl i'm crazy
For your love
Out of my
Head for you

My mind just
Can't believe
What you're
Makin' my
Body do
I'm delirieus
Over you
And i just can't

Get enough
You're drivin'
Me mad
Makin'me crazy
For your love
Thought i heard
The telephone
Ringin'

It must be my
Imagination
Thought i heard
A knockin'
On the door

I guess that it
Was wichful thinkin'
When close
My eyes

I can see
Your face
And feel you
Touchin' me

Oh darlin' don't
You know
I need to find
A real way
To make you see
That i'm crazy
For your love
Out of my head for you

My mind just
Can't believe
What you're
Makin' my
Body do
I'm delirieus
Over you
And i just can't

Get enough

When close
My eyes
I can see
Your face
And feel you
Touchin' me
Oh darling' don't
You know

I need to find
A real way
To make you see
That i'm crazy
For your love
Out of my head for you
You're drivin'
Me mad
Makin'me crazy
Makin'me crazy
For your love
Oh ooh
Making' me crazy
