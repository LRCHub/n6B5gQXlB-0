I'm crazy, crazy for feelin' so lonely
And I'm crazy, crazy for feelin' so blue
And I knew, you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then some day, you'd leave me for somebody new

Worry, why do I let myself worry?
Wonderin', what in the world did I do?
I'm crazy, for thinkin' that my love could hold you
And I'm crazy for tryin'
I'm crazy for cryin'
I'm crazy for lovin' you
